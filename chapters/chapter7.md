<choice id=1>

<opt text="FCN-32 have often the best output as they are very fine-granular">

This is not the correct answer.

</opt>

<opt text="FCN-32 are often better than FCN-16 as they upsample more">

This is not the correct answer.

</opt>

<opt text="The U-Net gives often the best output as regions are fine-granular" correct=True>

Perfect!

</opt>

<exercise id="51" title="Image segmentation Results of the Notebook">
	Run the given notebook about image segmentation.
<choice id="1">

<opt text="FCN-16 performs 3% points better than FCN-32 in the mean accuracy metric">

This is not the correct answer.

</opt>

<opt text="Segmentations performed by FCN-32 look very clear and have almost no difference to the true label">

This is not the correct answer.

</opt>

<opt text="The U-Net has a higer IoU for classes 0 and 1 for the test set" correct=True>

Perfect!

</opt>

<exercise id="52" title="Playing with the code - Image Segmentation">
a) Try to improve the existing solutions in the notebook
b) Find a semantic segemntation dataset on your own and test FCN vs U-Net
