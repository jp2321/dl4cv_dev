<opt text="FCN-32 have often the best output as they are very fine-granular">

This is not the correct answer.

</opt>

<opt text="FCN-32 are often better than FCN-16 as they upsample more">

This is not the correct answer.

</opt>

<opt text="The U-Net gives often the best output as regions are fine-granular" correct=True>

Perfect!

Change now the epochs of the U-Net to 50. What happens to the performance

<choice id="2">

<opt text="The U-Net performance breaks down due to overfitting" correct=True>

Perfect!

</opt>

<opt text="The U-Net performance increases to an IoU of 0.85 in class 1">
